My name is Jennie Chu and I am an avid learner. Two years ago, I started learning the basics of web development. I familiarized myself with basic HTML, CSS, BootStrap, and JQuery, all of which led  to me creating personal websites for my friends and I.

I have always loved solving and tinkering with puzzles. Hoping to become the next Indiana Jones, I studied Geology and Archaeology. Eventually, I began working as a College Counselor for low-income and first generation college students to give back to my community before teaching myself web design. 

Currently, I am a student at Holberton School, a two-year program that mentors students into becoming Full-Stack Engineers. This website is a showcase of blogs and projects I have done during my time as a Holberton student.

On my free time away from counseling, designing, and coding, I love playing video games, especially Dota2!
